Kidney Stone Prediction Using Random Forest

This repository implements a machine learning model for predicting kidney stone risk utilizing the Random Forest algorithm.

Key Features:
- Data Collection: Collects and analyzes factors influencing kidney stone development, such as age, sex, diet, hydration, BMI, and medical history.
- Data Preprocessing: Employs techniques like SMOTE to address class imbalance, enhancing the model's reliability.
- Model Training: Utilizes a Random Forest Classifier to effectively model and predict outcomes based on the training data.
- Model Evaluation: Assesses performance through accuracy metrics, confusion matrices, and classification reports, supplemented with visualizations like heatmaps and scatter plots.
- User Input for Prediction**: Allows real-time data input for individual risk assessment, providing immediate predictions and visual comparisons.

This project aims to support healthcare professionals in identifying at-risk individuals, facilitating timely interventions and improved patient care.
